WeatherLens is a weather app that allows users to check the weather conditions in different locations across the United States. With WeatherLens, users can:

* View the current temperature, wind speed, humidity, and other weather conditions in any location in the United States.
* Check the weather forecast for the next 6 days.

## Installation
Future releases will be made available on this GitHub repository. When released, users can download and unzip the file, and run the .jar file within.

## Usage
When you first open WeatherLens, you will be prompted to log in or create an account. Once you have logged in, you can use the app to view the weather conditions for any location in the United States. If you prefer not to create an account, you can use the application as a guest.
